📊 Bank Loan Analysis – Power BI Project
🔍 Project Overview

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to uncover key insights related 
to loan performance, borrower behavior, and lending trends. The project is designed to support
data-driven decision-making by transforming raw loan data into interactive dashboards and actionable insights.


The analysis is structured across three dashboards: Summary, Overview, and Details, each serving a distinct analytical purpose.

📌 Dashboard 1: Summary – KPI Performance Analysis
Key Metrics Tracked:

Total Loan Applications: Overall count of loan applications with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) comparisons.
Total Funded Amount: Total loan amount disbursed, including MTD performance and MoM growth analysis.
Total Amount Received: Total repayments collected from borrowers, helping assess cash flow and repayment behavior.
Average Interest Rate: Analysis of average interest rates across all loans with MTD and MoM trends.
Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: Measurement of borrower financial health and repayment capacity.

Visualization:
Loan Status Summary Grid:
A consolidated view of loan performance categorized by Loan Status, displaying metrics such as application 
volume, funded amount, repayments received, average interest rate, and DTI.


📊 Dashboard 2: Overview – Trend & Distribution Analysis
This dashboard provides a macro-level view of lending operations using multiple visualizations:
Monthly Loan Trends (Line Chart): Highlights seasonal patterns and long-term trends in loan issuance.
State-wise Loan Distribution (Filled Map): Identifies high-lending regions and regional disparities.
Loan Term Distribution (Donut Chart): Visualizes loans across different repayment durations.
Employment Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Examines lending behavior based on borrower employment experience.
Loan Purpose Analysis (Bar Chart): Breaks down loans by stated purpose to identify dominant borrowing needs.
Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Shows the impact of home ownership status on loan applications and disbursement.


📋 Dashboard 3: Details – Granular Loan Insights
Objective:
The Details Dashboard enables deep-dive analysis of individual loans, borrower profiles, and repayment metrics.
It allows users to filter and explore data efficiently, supporting risk assessment and portfolio monitoring.
